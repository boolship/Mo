Set Console Window & Buffer sizes, QuickEdit, other options 
from command line.

The "mo" program runs under any .Net versions or WinOS.
Successfully tested on installed frameworks .Net 2.0-4.5 
and on WinOS XP thru Windows 8. Runs in Console with DOS 
or Bash shells.

You only need four files: mo, mo.cmd, mo20.exe, mo40.exe
They are located in same directory as this README file.
The rest of the stuff is for Visual Studio. 

Runtime and Visual Studio notes:

(0) Copy the four files into your WinOS path, run "mo" in 
DOS console or Bash shell on windows, e.g. Git Bash. For
help run "mo x".

(1) The main project "mo40" source files are linked into
the "mo20" project. The "mo20" project is a target 
framework executable, without source. The test project 
"TestMo" references the main project "mo40".

(2) Each project post build event copies target 
framework 2.0 and 4.0 executables into this directory.

(3) This solution was built with Visual Studio 2010.
Since Visual Studion 2010 does not target frameworks 
v1.0 and v1.1 these are not supported.

(4) The batch file mo.cmd runs a .Net program with the 
same name and version suffix. Convention requires a 
set of target executables. It works under .Net 2.0-4.5 
versions and on WinOS XP through Windows 8. 

(5) The script mo runs (in Bash shell) a .Net program 
with the same name and version suffix. Convention
requires a set of target executables. It works under 
.Net 2.0-4.5 versions and on WinOS XP through Windows 8.

Good luck.
